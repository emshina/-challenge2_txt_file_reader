Power learn Project is a Pan-African Non-governmental Organisation
 that is here to see through a transformative Africa by equipping the youth with technology skills.

We believe in truly placing the power of knowledge, technology,
 and opportunity in the hands of the youth. Through our flagship program, 
 the #1MillionDevs4Africa initiative has scaled to 5 African countries: onboarding 5,000+ learners from Kenya, Nigeria,
  South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia onto our unique, custom-made learning platform.
